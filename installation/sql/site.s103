The most amazing thing I learned was that I could actually choose to let go of those negative feelings, I never realized I had that option. The steps and the tapping technique Aimee uses helped me let go and instead begin to realize that I deserve self-love and that I can value myself. I’m going to be honest, it was not easy, and I did have to deal with some painful memories, but it was soooo worth it to feel this way. I just didn’t realize it was possible until I made the commitment to really work on myself.

I had tried everything to get him to do more but that just caused stress and conflict. I felt resigned to the fact that I had to do everything and sacrifice my career so my children received the care they deserve. I applied all the manifesting techniques that worked with great success in other areas of my life, but I just couldn’t make any headway on my own with the family issue. After I worked with Aimee, almost miraculously, my husband began stepping up to the mark without my saying a thing! His relationship with the kids improved almost immediately and suddenly I had the freedom to pursue my career as well!  I now have a new balance and a sense of freedom I didn’t have before. I was even able to go overseas alone for a week-long conference and leave the kids and dad to do it alone. Prior to working with Aimee this would have been impossible.

We bickered and argued a lot. I felt exhausted, discouraged, frustrated, and had a lot of muscle tension and sometimes a panicky feeling. After just the first week of the class, I noticed there was already less tension, less arguments. After the 2nd week, I noticed that my panic feeling was going away. When I did start to become upset, I could tap on it to get rid of the uncomfortable feelings and calm down. I also became aware of my patterns and could choose to respond differently, which helped us both. I am so relieved. The class helped me to focus on the issue in a consistent way, which I would not have done otherwise.

The most amazing thing I learned was that I could actually choose to let go of those negative feelings, I never realized I had that option. The steps and the tapping technique Aimee uses helped me let go and instead begin to realize that I deserve self-love and that I can value myself. I’m going to be honest, it was not easy, and I did have to deal with some painful memories, but it was soooo worth it to feel this way. I just didn’t realize it was possible until I made the commitment to really work on myself. I am grateful for the process and the tapping technique that helped me to get to this much more hopeful, peaceful place[/offer_testimonial]\r\n\r\n[offer_testimonial cite=\"- Anna, Australia\"]\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\n“It feels like someone has taken a set of chains off me.”\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\nEven though my husband is kind and means well, he was nowhere near carrying his weight parenting. I had tried everything to get him to do more but that just caused stress and conflict. I felt resigned to the fact that I had to do everything and sacrifice my career so my children received the care they deserve. I applied all the manifesting techniques that worked with great success in other areas of my life, but I just couldn’t make any headway on my own with the family issue. After I worked with Aimee, almost miraculously, my husband began stepping up to the mark without my saying a thing! His relationship with the kids improved almost immediately and suddenly I had the freedom to pursue my career as well!  I now have a new balance and a sense of freedom I didn’t have before. I was even able to go overseas alone for a week-long conference and leave the kids and dad to do it alone. Prior to working with Aimee this would have been impossible. It feels like someone has taken a set of chains off me.
