We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energy that both people give creates a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: when you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1\">[image id=\"29803\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-11\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things. We’ve all experienced it on a small scale – when you are in a bad mood, angry, or frustrated, even something that you normally enjoy just isn’t as satisfying, you can’t enjoy it as much.

We often judge the quality of our life based on how good we feel about our relationships – with husbands/boyfriends, parents, children, siblings, and best friends.\r\n\r\nIf we are happy and content with each of those relationships, then our life is usually pretty fulfilling.\r\n\r\nBut so often, there is one or more close relationships in our life that cause us pain. We feel unappreciated. Misunderstood. Taken for granted.\r\n\r\nWe so badly want to feel heard, valued, and appreciated, and when we don’t, we often feel it physically as a pit in our stomach, a knot in our throat, or pressure on our chest.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have had some of the following thoughts about one of your personal relationships\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"27425\" align=\"none\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">About your husband/boyfriend/partner:</p>\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>I’ve lost the connection we used to have.</li>\r\n 	<li>I feel lonely, even though we live together.

We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energy that both people give creates a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: when you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">\r\n[image id=\"27465\" align=\"right\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things. We’ve all experienced it on a small scale – when you are in a bad mood, angry, or frustrated, even something that you normally enjoy just isn’t as satisfying, you can’t enjoy it as much. You end up stubbing your toe, or catching all the red lights.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<p>But when you are in a great mood, you can put up with just about anything that comes your way, sometimes even housework can be fun!

We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energy that both people give creates a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: when you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"29987\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things. We’ve all experienced it on a small scale – when you are in a bad mood, angry, or frustrated, even something that you normally enjoy just isn’t as satisfying, you can’t enjoy it as much. You end up stubbing your toe, or catching all the red lights.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<p>But when you are in a great mood, you can put up with just about anything that comes your way, sometimes even housework can be fun! And if you still do catch a red light, you don’t even care. So our own energy patterns really do affect how we experience the world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\">[image id=\"29806\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<p>\r\nSo the overlooked SOLUTION is: If you can CHANGE THE ENERGY YOU ARE PUTTING INTO THE RELATIONSHIP, then you can change how you experience the relationship.\r\n\r\nAnd even when they do things that used to frustrate you, you will find it doesn’t bother you as much.And a wonderful byproduct of that change is that the OTHER person will find themselves acting differently because the fuel, or energy, that you are supplying has changed.\r\n</p>\r\n[image id=\"27469\" align=\"center\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]\r\n<p>But how do you CHANGE THE ENERGY?

We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energy that both people give creates a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: when you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1\" style=\"margin-left:50px\">[image id=\"29987\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things. We’ve all experienced it on a small scale – when you are in a bad mood, angry, or frustrated, even something that you normally enjoy just isn’t as satisfying, you can’t enjoy it as much. You end up stubbing your toe, or catching all the red lights.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-10\">\r\n<p>But when you are in a great mood, you can put up with just about anything that comes your way, sometimes even housework can be fun!
