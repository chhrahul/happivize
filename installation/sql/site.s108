We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energy that both people give creates a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: when you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1\" style=\"margin-left:50px\">[image id=\"29987\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\" style=\"margin-right:50px\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things.

If we are happy and content with each of these relationships, then our life is usually pretty fulfilling.\r\n\r\nSo often, though, there are one or more close relationships in our life that cause us pain. We feel unappreciated. Misunderstood. Taken for granted. We so badly want to feel heard, valued, and appreciated, and when we don’t, we often feel it physically as a pit in our stomach, a knot in our throat, or pressure on our chest.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have had some of the following thoughts about one of your personal relationships...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"27425\" align=\"none\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">About your husband/boyfriend/partner:</p>\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>We’ve lost the connection we used to have.</li>\r\n 	<li>I feel lonely, even though we live together.

We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energies that both people give create a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: When you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1\" style=\"margin-left:50px\">[image id=\"29987\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\" style=\"margin-right:50px\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things.
