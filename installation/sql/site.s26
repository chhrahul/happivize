It was as finally I had a dream come true. I had somebody to ask all these questions, somebody that was ahead on the path but still accessible and that I could connect with on a human level as well. Arathi Ma shared her story with us, answered countless questions, was patient when I was impatient with myself and never lost hope in my recovery. She didn’t do the work for me but she offered tools, dikshas, and guidance. <strong>She helped me to recover from 30 years of depression and 7 years of Chronic Fatigue</strong>. Through her help I also became a Reiki Master/Teacher and started my own practice as an energy healer and teacher. It is a journey worth traveling and with Arathi Ma you will have a trustworthy guide by your side.</em><p></p>     \r\n<img src=\"https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bb.png\" alt=\"bb\" width=\"26\" height=\"17\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1230\" /> \r\n </div>\r\n<div class=\"bc\">\r\n<span>- Blessings, Susanne\", Yukon \"></span>\r\n            </span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"monial-content\">\r\n\r\n<p></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">AWAKENING TO BLISS</span></p><br>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">“Profoundly life-changing…. can only be described as bliss.”</span></strong></p><br>\r\n<em>My sessions with Arathi Ma have been <strong>profoundly life-changing</strong>.

There are cellular and system mechanisms that make this happen, and Lynn can get those mechanisms online again and more efficient. For example, more mitochondria means more fat burning!</dd>\r\n 	<dt>Clear Past Lives, Ancestry, and Entities — which can be a big piece of the puzzle!</dt>\r\n 	<dd>Have you ever thought about what your past lives might have to do with your body’s journey? What about your ancestor’s energies? Energies that aren’t yours? Lynn takes us through clearing any contracts, vows, agreements, and curses that can be affecting us now.</dd>\r\n 	<dt>Heal your body\'s weight regulation systems</dt>\r\n 	<dd>Research has been telling us that your body’s systems are supposed to regulate your weight, like your naturally thin friends do – they don’t hold on to every morsel of food they eat! Lynn will dive into our bodies and tune up the communication systems, so that for example when our fat tissues secrete the hormone leptin telling our hypothalamus to stop storing fat, that system actually works!</dd>\r\n 	<dt>Negotiate with your body so you co-create something amazing</dt>\r\n 	<dd>When are you most helpful? When you are ridiculed, hated, starved, and unloved? Or when you are valued, listened to, nourished, and loved? Our bodies respond the same way.

Anna said:\r\n\r\n“For years I’ve struggled with my weight, and I’ve literally tried every diet. I was the reporter for Channel 4’s diet series Supersize vs Superskinny, and my challenge was to immerse myself in the world of extreme diets and to communicate back the truth.”\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Does any of this sound familiar?</p>\r\n“At the time of being asked, I was a little insulted. In my head I was a svelte 126 lb, size 8 stunner—whereas in reality I was a hefty 161 lb size 14 porker. Overweight and in complete denial. A fact that only became apparent to me when I agreed to weigh myself on camera, for the first time in seven years. I was devastated.\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1543\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nSo I threw myself with gusto into the diets I was trialling, which included: The Apple Diet (apples… that’s it. Favoured by supermodels), diet pills (ditto), the Baby Food Diet (beloved by Hollywood A listers), the Maple Syrup Diet (beloved by Beyonce), the Baked Bean Diet (beloved by no-one), and as a last resort, Liposuction (which went wrong).\r\n\r\nI was by turns constipated, flatulent, hungry, and in pain. And after all this, did I lose any weight? Just a few pounds.”\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1561\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">But then it all changed.</p>\r\n\r\n“The change came when I went to see Marisa Peer for a session. It was while I was under hypnosis that I quite had a ‘lightbulb moment’—an acknowledgment of where my issues with food began, and the realisation that I didn’t want to be a prisoner to food any longer. Put simply, \"I made a decision to change.\"\r\n\r\nIn an interview with The Telegraph (a major UK newspaper), the lovely Anna Richardson talks about how she lost over 35 lbs and kept it off for over four years after just one session with Marisa Peer.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[image id=\"1560\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\n\r\nHer interest was sparked during the filming of Supersize vs Superskinny in 2008. Anna had undergone a Regression Session (part of Marisa’s unique method) with well-known celebrity therapist Marisa Peer, and discovered that her own eating habits were formed during early childhood. Her mother was taken into hospital. Her father had tried to comfort Anna—in her mother’s absence—by feeding her treats, fast food, and fizzy drinks. And so a relationship between food and comfort was firmly established.\r\n\r\nYet, after one session where Marisa cured the problem rooted from her past, Anna lost over 35 lbs, to settle at under 132 lbs—the exact weight she had told Marisa she considered her perfect weight. \"I found myself making better food choices, without realising it—it was weird,\" she admits.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Introducing Marisa Peer</p>\r\n\r\nMarisa Peer studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world.

Since overeating is an emotional issue, it cannot be defeated with logic.\r\n<h4>So how do we change these behaviors?</h4>\r\nOne of the most effective methods is weight loss motivation hypnosis. Hypnosis is something you have already experienced many, many times in your everyday life. \r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1578\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nWhen you are engrossed in a film or activity and lose all track of time, you are experiencing a state similar to hypnosis. When you drive your car on a familiar route on autopilot and don’t even notice you did it, you are in a state of hypnosis.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1585\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\nOnly recently, one of America’s leading psychiatrists conducted experiments on volunteers that proved how much the brain could influence our thoughts when under hypnosis. Given that the subconscious mind is responsible for 90% of our actions, if we can change our mind, we can change our behaviour too. So how exactly does it work? Hypnosis alters our state of consciousness in such a way that our conscious (thinking) mind is switched off and our unconscious (emotional) mind is made more alert.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nBecause the unconscious mind is a deep-seated, more instinctive force, it is this part of the brain that listens to the words the therapist is using and uses them to re-program negative patterns of behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn Perfect Weight Forever I will use a safe and effective form of hypnosis to change how you react to food forever.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[image id=\"2821\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">Research shows that 95% of people find diets ineffective.</h4>\r\n<b>This is because diets focus on the wrong thing.</b>\r\n\r\nAccording to the eating disorder charity BEAT, 88% of people who have eating problems and weight loss problems have these problems because they have an emotional relationship with food. 85% of people comfort eat because they have a negative body image.\r\n\r\nEmotional eaters use food to soothe unhappy feelings and to temporarily solve anger, loneliness, and unhappiness because eating temporarily switches off their negative emotions.\r\n\r\nThe key emotional states that send you into emotional eating are anger, hurt, loneliness, betrayal, frustrations, jealousy, guilt, resentment, shame, helplessness, powerlessness, stress, tiredness, and many others that may be more subtle. But eating will never cure these feelings; it just makes them worse.\r\n\r\nA third of women snack in secret and then feel ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, and out of control, and those negative feelings just make it a vicious circle that keeps the overeating going even though you long to be free of it.\r\n\r\nNot only the food you ate as a child, but also your parents’ relationships with food, will affect how you eat. I have so many clients who in hypnosis go back to events that leave them with a belief that says, ‘I can’t eat like other people.’ If your mother rarely gave you candy or punished you by removing candy, if your parents were poor and you only had very basic food, the belief you picked up at a very early age and had reinforced over and over again is: ‘I can’t eat what other people eat,’ ‘I can’t have nice food or treats.\'\r\n\r\nThis means that when you’re denied the food that you want and have no power or say in it, of course you long to have the food that other kids have in their lunchbox, in their cupboards, or at their parties.\r\n\r\nYears later, when of course you have access to all that food, you still believe that you shouldn’t have it because of your on-going weight battle.\r\n\r\nYou still have that old belief ‘It’s not available to me,’ and ‘I can’t have what other people have,’ and ‘Other people get those foods but I don’t.’ Even though you are trying to consciously deny yourself those foods and want to be free of them, what’s happening is that you feel exactly like that kid who didn’t get them and wanted them so much, and now you just want them even more and feel powerless to resist them.\r\n\r\nIt is this thinking that sabotages your diet efforts.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">Why diets, pills and similar treatments like gastric band surgery don’t work</p>\r\nDiets are too restrictive, which makes them hard to stick to. When you know that 95% of people who go on a diet put all the weight back on within a year (and often some additional weight too), it shows that diets don’t work. The longest time we can stay on a diet is just 6 weeks, and many people only manage a few days.\r\n\r\nDiet and exercise don’t tackle the issues that drive people to overeat. There is always an emotional reason, and usually it’s for comfort when people are stressed, unhappy, vulnerable, or bored.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2830\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nOver 70% of overeaters are emotional eaters and addictive eaters. Another 20% are habitual and ignorant eaters, and only 10% are angry eaters. You need to know what sort of eater you are before you can address the problem, which is something that no amount of diets, pills, or gastric band treatments can do.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2829\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">What’s wrong with processed foods like margarine, crisps, chocolates, and candy?</p>\r\nChips, cakes, chocolates, cookies, pastries, candy, and fast food are NOT foods. Junk food and fast food are not foods at all—they are a cocktail of chemicals, colorings, sugar, trans fat, and preservatives, and the body becomes addicted to these chemicals. They make the body release dopamine the same way drugs do, and as with all addictions we need more and more of the drug just to get the same effect. A diet of burgers, chips, pizza, and cake will program your brain into craving even more foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat, according to new research. Over the years, these junk foods can become a substitute for happiness and will lead binges to become addicted.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nMy method teaches you to make the right food choices. It will show you that candy and chocolate are not food and they will never make you feel better. Your body would never ask you for chips or junk food because it hates trying to break down all the fat and chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe only part of you that thinks you want this is your mind, and soon you will be controlling, directing, and influencing your mind to be indifferent to rubbish food forever. This does not mean you will never eat cake or candy, it just means you want it less, eat it less, and are satisfied with less all the time.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<h4>Introducing...

The spiritual energy and channeled content in each module allows you and your Soul to shift rapidly from your existing state to a better, happier, and more joyful state. Your true nature, your Soul Essence, is love. You are born that way. Each of the 8 modules in Package A was developed with this foremost in mind.</div>\r\nEach module looks at a different area of life and will assist you to be come more of who you really are, your authentic self. This also allows your Divine Soul Essence to express itself better in the area of your choosing.\r\n\r\nThrough each of the modules, the flow of love will improve in the relevant aspects of your life. This creates a better, more balanced life, thus improving your overall quality of life.\r\n\r\nIf you are ready to experience more flow of love and well-being, more of who you really are, then modules can assist you.\r\n\r\nEach of these 8 modules comprises of both an eBook and MP3s. The eBook helps with additional insights on how to improve the relevant area of your life.\r\n\r\nThere are more details at the end of each of the accompanying eBooks, as well as in the last recording of each set.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to a set of MP3s, the spiritual healing will continue to run for 5 to 7 days afterwards. Each module can be repeated after a week. After listening to a module, a break of 24 hours is needed before the next module can be listened to.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]HOW DOES THE HEALING TAKE PLACE?[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">We are all born with a unique or authentic self within. This authentic self knows why you were born. It knows the overall direction of your life at any given moment. It completely understands you and knows what is needed to heal the obstacles you are dealing with. It knows why you are stressed, or why you may not be feeling so loving, or why you don’t like your present situation any longer.With the help of Spirit and the channeled content on each MP3, these blockages and stresses will automatically begin to clear. A more natural and authentic version of yourself will begin to emerge after you have listened to any of the MP3s. After each listening, you can continue with your life as normal. Spirit knows the right timing for each of the embedded clearings. The wisdom of your Soul and Spirit will do all the clearings for you, while you can continue with your normal day-to-day living.\r\n\r\nThis Divine healing process is unique and was given to Mia in 2002, after which her healings became more profound, and she was able to perform more and more miracle healings.

However, initially I did not give it the attention it deserved. Thus, I gradually became more and more stressed, and only started to take more notice when I developed somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me, my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200).</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-3\">[image id=\"27851\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">As a result of my high blood pressure and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could lead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it my all, and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fix the retina issue within weeks, which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day, my blood pressure has been within the normal range without having ever needed any medication.An elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago. By the time I found out, she had already received many hours of physiotherapy, as well as 15 injections. As nothing was helping, she could barely speak from the pain when I phoned her from Australia. With her permission, I started a very intensive daily distant healing process (she lives in the Netherlands), and continued for about 5 days. After the 5 days, she was pain free, and that severe pain never returned. It turned out it was caused by a swelling or bulge around the spinal area called L4. Based on scans prior to my having given her these healings, her specialist had decided she needed an operation. Spirit told me at the end of the 5-day healing that she no longer needed this operation. This was confirmed 3 months later, during a visit to the specialist who was going to perform her operation. This visit had already been booked before I began the healings. She was told by this specialist she no longer needed the operation. That same problem has never returned.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, one of my relatives, who was in her 80s, was diagnosed with end-stage renal failure with less than 10% of her kidneys still working. It was no longer possible for her to get a transplant or receive dialysis because of other major health implications. When I began giving her distant healings, she was already completely bedridden. Within less than two weeks, she was fully mobile again. I was privileged to give her quality of life during that period. Much to the shock and amazement of those around her, she was able to walk and travel and visit family until a few days before her transition 12 weeks later.\"\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rd0FGvNANpU?ecver=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6og7XzzZOk?ecver=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGd5J6EkRBw?ecver=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Mia den Haan - Divine Soul Essence Healing', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'divine-soul-essence', '', '', '2017-05-26 10:51:19', '2017-05-26 14:51:19', '', '0', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=dnc-wc-offer&#038;p=1740', '0', 'dnc-wc-offer', '', '0'), ('1769', '216', '2017-02-28 05:26:06', '2017-02-28 05:26:06', '', '9r', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '9r', '', '', '2017-02-28 05:26:06', '2017-02-28 05:26:06', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/9r.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1773', '216', '2017-02-28 05:32:05', '2017-02-28 05:32:05', '', '20r', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '20r', '', '', '2017-02-28 05:32:05', '2017-02-28 05:32:05', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20r.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1774', '216', '2017-02-28 05:35:29', '2017-02-28 05:35:29', '', 'ornament-3', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', 'ornament-3', '', '', '2017-02-28 05:35:29', '2017-02-28 05:35:29', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ornament-3.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1778', '216', '2017-02-28 05:58:13', '2017-02-28 05:58:13', '', 'Amandar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', 'amandar', '', '', '2017-02-28 05:58:13', '2017-02-28 05:58:13', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amandar.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1781', '216', '2017-02-28 06:11:26', '2017-02-28 06:11:26', '', 'Gea2r', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', 'gea2r', '', '', '2017-02-28 06:11:26', '2017-02-28 06:11:26', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gea2r.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1782', '216', '2017-02-28 06:13:43', '2017-02-28 06:13:43', '', 'Britr', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', 'britr', '', '', '2017-02-28 06:13:43', '2017-02-28 06:13:43', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Britr.png', '0', 'attachment', 'image/png', '0'), ('1783', '158', '2017-02-28 06:26:14', '2017-02-28 06:26:14', '[affiliates_is_affiliate]\r\n<div class=\"affiliate_info_wrap\">[cwa id=\'affiliatewidget\']\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-sm-6 after_info_warp\">\r\n<div class=\"tab-content\">\r\n<div id=\"welcome-v\" class=\"tab-pane active\" style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\r\n\r\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don\'t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn\'t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/affiliates_is_affiliate]\r\n[affiliates_is_not_affiliate]\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Not an affiliate.</p>\r\n[/affiliates_is_not_affiliate]', 'Welcome Affiliate', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '775-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-02-28 06:26:14', '2017-02-28 06:26:14', '', '775', 'https://happivize.com/775-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'), ('1784', '216', '2017-02-28 06:42:36', '2017-02-28 06:42:36', '', 'unnamed-1', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', 'unnamed-1', '', '', '2017-02-28 06:42:36', '2017-02-28 06:42:36', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/unnamed-1.jpg', '0', 'attachment', 'image/jpeg', '0'), ('1786', '216', '2017-02-28 12:30:21', '2017-02-28 12:30:21', '<div class=\"container\">\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF6600\"]\n<h2>Mia Den Haan\'s Special Offer</h2>\n[/offer_section]\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-6 column\">\n<ul>\n 	<li>Improve the quality of love that is already present within your self</li>\n 	<li>Clear environmental triggers or memory patterns that are blocking your love from flowing freely</li>\n 	<li>Release blocks to allow for more loving relationships with others in your life</li>\n 	<li>Increase mental and emotional wellbeing</li>\n 	<li>Reduce stress levels, panic attacks, anxiety, trauma</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7 column\">\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF0000\"]\n<h4>Experience More Love In All Areas Of Your Life</h4>\n[/offer_section]\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#0087CF\"]\n<h3>BUILD YOUR LOVE FLOW FROM WITHIN WITH ASSISTANCE OF THE YOUR DIVINE SOUL ESSENCE™ HEALING METHOD[/offer_section]</h3>\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF0000\"]\n<h4>Become Whole With Assistance Of The Divine Within</h4>\n[/offer_section]\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\n\nAttract more love in your life through the healing power of Spirit.

Remember the woman you worked with, who was having troubles with her hip? At the time, you said that that particular healing probably wouldn’t be available to others, since she had such a complicated personal tangle to undo around it.\n\nSol I really wasn’t expecting anything, but I noticed a short while later that my own hips (which are better but still a little rigid, the remains of a neuromuscularimmune etc. illness) were moving better! I had more fluidity, and more range of motion in them.\n\nYou may already have gotten tons of feedback of this kind, but I just wanted to be sure you know that your own range may be greater than you imagine!\n\n[/offer_testimonial]\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\n<div>\n\n[offer_testimonial cite=\"~ Marcia\"]\n<div align=\"center\">[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF0000\"]CLEARING OF NECK PAIN[/offer_section]</div>\n“Mia, your group calls are amazing! I\'ve been on almost all of them and they seem to be getting more powerful each time. I feel I am getting the same benefit from the group healings as I do from private sessions with you. During last night\'s call I was quite uncomfortable because my neck was acting up again. It was jammed, tight, and painful. By the end of the call I was very relaxed but my neck wasn\'t any better.

My pain level went from a 10 plus to a 3 in a very short time.\n\n</div>\nAlso within a week of listening to Mia\'s weight loss MP3’s I lost five pounds and I was thrilled as I have been a very resistant case. I felt my body was finally responding. I even planned on eating nothing but smoothies but ate regularly after the first two and lost weight anyway. I appreciate Mia’s generosity, insight and steady belief it could happen. She took me back to my time at college and a volcanic eruption that disrupted my sense of safety.

Thus I became gradually more and more stressed and only started to take more notice when I had a somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200). Resulting from that and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\">[image id=\"1795\" align=\"none\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-12 column\">\n\nlead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it all and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fixed the retina issue within weeks which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day my blood pressure has been within the normal range without ever needing any medication.An elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago. By the time I found out she had already received many hours of physiotherapy as well as 15 injections. As nothing was helping she could barely speak from the pain when I phoned her from Australia. With her permission I started a very intensive daily distant healing process (she lives in the Netherlands) for about 5 days. After the 5 days she was pain free and that severe pain never returned. It turned out it was caused by a swelling or bulge around the spinal area called L4. Based on scans prior to giving her these healings, her specialist had decided she needed an operation. Spirit told me at the end of the 5 days healing that she no longer needed this operation. This was confirmed 3 months later, during a visit to the specialist who was going to perform her operation. This visit was already booked before I began the healings. She was told by this specialist she no longer needed the operation. That same problem has never returned.\n\nSeveral years ago one of my relatives who was in her 80s, was diagnosed with end stage renal failure with less than 10% of her kidneys still working. It was no longer possible for her to get a transplant or receive dialysis because of other major health implications. When I began giving her distant healings she was already completely bedridden. Within less than two weeks she was fully mobile again. I was privileged to give her quality of life during that period. Much to the shock and amazement of those around her she was able to walk and travel and visit family until a few days before her transition 12 weeks later.\"\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div

This authentic self knows why you were born. It knows the overall direction of your life at any given moment. It completely understands you and knows what is needed to heal the obstacles you are dealing with. It knows why you are stressed or may not be feeling so loving or why you don’t like your present situation any longer.\n\nWith the help of spirit and the channeled content on each MP3, these blockages and stresses will automatically begin to clear. A more natural and authentic version of yourself will begin to emerge after you have listened to any of the MP3s. After each listening you can continue with your life as normal. Spirit knows the right timing for each of the embedded clearings. The wisdom of your soul and spirit will do all the clearings for you, while you can continue with your normal day-to-day living.\n\nThis Divine healing process is unique and was given to Mia in 2002, after which her healings became more profound and she was able to perform more and more miracle healings. Mia has a multisensory awareness and can simultaneously provide healing in multiple dimensions with help of her clairvoyant and channeling ability and with help of spiritual guidance.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF0000\"]\n<h3>Read some of Mia\'s success stories</h3>\n[/offer_section]\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\n\n[offer_testimonial cite=\"~ Amanda T. – Wynnum Australia\"]\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n[offer_section width=\"full\" background=\"\" color=\"#FF0000\"]HEALED DIABETIC RETINOPATHY AND IMPROVED DIABETES TYPE 1[/offer_section]</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\">[image id=\"1778\" align=\"none\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 column\">\nI had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy in my left eye in December 2009.

I can now manage my diabetes and with less insulin than before the healings. I was also given help with both ketoacidosis, with apparently only 4 hours to live, as well as a blood clot in my left arm. I have on many separate occasions had bad family situations just suddenly change for the better after a session.

Thus I became gradually more and more stressed and only started to take more notice when I had a somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200). Resulting from that and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\">[image id=\"1795\" align=\"none\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-12 column\">\n\nlead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it all and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fixed the retina issue within weeks which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day my blood pressure has been within the normal range without ever needing any medication.An elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago. By the time I found out she had already received many hours of physiotherapy as well as 15 injections. As nothing was helping she could barely speak from the pain when I phoned her from Australia. With her permission I started a very intensive daily distant healing process (she lives in the Netherlands) for about 5 days. After the 5 days she was pain free and that severe pain never returned. It turned out it was caused by a swelling or bulge around the spinal area called L4. Based on scans prior to giving her these healings, her specialist had decided she needed an operation. Spirit told me at the end of the 5 days healing that she no longer needed this operation. This was confirmed 3 months later, during a visit to the specialist who was going to perform her operation. This visit was already booked before I began the healings. She was told by this specialist she no longer needed the operation. That same problem has never returned.\n\nSeveral years ago one of my relatives who was in her 80s, was diagnosed with end stage renal failure with less than 10% of her kidneys still working. It was no longer possible for her to get a transplant or receive dialysis because of other major health implications. When I began giving her distant healings she was already completely bedridden. Within less than two weeks she was fully mobile again. I was privileged to give her quality of life during that period. Much to the shock and amazement of those around her she was able to walk and travel and visit family until a few days before her transition 12 weeks later.\"\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-1 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rd0FGvNANpU?ecver=1\" width=\"270\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6og7XzzZOk?ecver=1\" width=\"270\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGd5J6EkRBw?ecver=1\" width=\"270\" height=\"169\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-1 column\"></div>\n</div>', 'Mia', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1740-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-03-02 15:42:51', '2017-03-02 15:42:51', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/1740-autosave-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'), ('1824', '222', '2017-03-01 02:28:17', '2017-03-01 02:28:17', '', '', '', 'wcm-active', 'open', 'closed', 'um_58b631c13f519', '1824', '', '', '2017-03-01 02:28:17', '2017-03-01 02:28:17', '', '504', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=wc_user_membership&p=1824', '0', 'wc_user_membership', '', '0'), ('1825', '223', '2017-03-01 02:29:02', '2017-03-01 02:29:02', '', '', '', 'wcm-active', 'open', 'closed', 'um_58b631eea8fd7', '1825', '', '', '2017-03-01 02:29:02', '2017-03-01 02:29:02', '', '504', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=wc_user_membership&p=1825', '0', 'wc_user_membership', '', '0'), ('1826', '93', '2017-03-01 02:51:38', '2017-03-01 07:51:38', 'Success and Spirit: Digital + Group Calls + Private Session with Mia den Haan', 'Success and Spirit + Recorded Group Calls', 'Success and Spirit:\r\n10 MP3s and 10 Ebooks\r\n4 Live Calls Apr/May 2017', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'success-with-spirit-package-b', '', '', '2017-05-27 22:09:00', '2017-05-28 02:09:00', '', '30606', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=product&#038;p=1826', '0', 'product', '', '0'), ('1828', '93', '2017-03-01 02:52:55', '2017-03-01 07:52:55', 'Success and Spirit: Digital + Group Calls + Private Session with Mia den Haan', 'Success and Spirit + Group Calls + Private Session', 'Success and Spirit:\r\n10 MP3s and 10 Ebooks\r\n4 Live Calls Apr/May 2017\r\n30 minute Private Session with Mia', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'success-and-spirit-package-c', '', '', '2017-05-27 22:08:51', '2017-05-28 02:08:51', '', '30606', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=product&#038;p=1828', '0', 'product', '', '0'), ('1829', '93', '2017-03-01 02:54:32', '2017-03-01 07:54:32', '', 'Happy Hormones and Weight - Package A', 'All Digital: 9 MP3s', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'happy-hormones-weight-digital', '', '', '2017-05-30 01:39:21', '2017-05-30 05:39:21', '', '30126', 'https://happivize.com/?post_type=product&#038;p=1829', '0', 'product', '', '0'), ('1830', '93', '2017-03-01 02:55:13', '2017-03-01 07:55:13', 'Happy Hormones &amp;

I bought it together with a personal session which adds extra value. I feel the personal session takes care of that which needs deeper digging so I always take the opportunity to buy the version with a session included. This is the 3d or maybe 4th time I bought one of her packages. I think they give much value in that they provide so much healing/clearing and can be used again and again. I just finished listening to the 5 modules on Success for the 2nd time and it feels like I am going to continue repeating them as I feel improvements each time. All in all I have seen great improvements since I started with Mia´s healing work about a year ago.

It goes deep and wide. This is support for life. Clearings go not only deep into many layers but also heal many aspects of the bigger picture to ensure continued success in the many areas where success is blocked.\r\n\r\nI started the program in a bit of a hurry as there were potential complications and delays brewing around an extra income source. As a result of using Mia\'s Divine Essence Soul Healing on Success, not only did the best outcome to my situation come about within the week I completed my first round of the 5 modules, another long-delayed project got the push it needed to progress. After 4 years of confusion, procrastination and feeling jinxed, these events were the long-awaited breakthroughs I needed to regain my confidence. I feel more directed than ever before.\r\n\r\nMia\'s unique teachings and clearings have furthered my understanding of soul and spirit in a way that has allowed my mind to quieten down enough for my heart to now lead the way to a life with less stress and more happiness. I am now ready to show up fully in the world, aligned with my Soul\'s purpose, and with Spirit\'s guidance.\r\n\r\n[/offer_testimonial]\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr />', 'Mia den Haan - Success
