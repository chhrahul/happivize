Whether it’s at work, with your finances, relationships or your health, a lack of self-love can cause you to sabotage your success and put yourself last. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s time to love yourself and enjoy the benefits in all areas of your life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reduce your fears, release the sense of inadequacy and eliminate the feeling that you are not enough... You are enough right now, and you deserve joy and happiness in your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a simple technique called EFT, you can balance your energy system through acupressure tapping.

Anna said:\n\n“For years I’ve struggled with my weight, and I’ve literally tried every diet. I was the reporter for Channel 4’s diet series Supersize vs Superskinny, and my challenge was to immerse myself in the world of extreme diets and to communicate back the truth.”\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Does any of this sound familiar?</p>\n“At the time of being asked, I was a little insulted. In my head I was a svelte 126 lb, size 8 stunner—whereas in reality I was a hefty 161 lb size 14 porker. Overweight and in complete denial. A fact that only became apparent to me when I agreed to weigh myself on camera, for the first time in seven years. I was devastated.\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1543\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\nSo I threw myself with gusto into the diets I was trialling, which included: The Apple Diet (apples… that’s it. Favoured by supermodels), diet pills (ditto), the Baby Food Diet (beloved by Hollywood A listers), the Maple Syrup Diet (beloved by Beyonce), the Baked Bean Diet (beloved by no-one), and as a last resort, Liposuction (which went wrong).\n\nI was by turns constipated, flatulent, hungry, and in pain. And after all this, did I lose any weight? Just a few pounds.”\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1561\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">But then it all changed.</p>\n\n“The change came when I went to see Marisa Peer for a session. It was while I was under hypnosis that I quite had a ‘lightbulb moment’—an acknowledgment of where my issues with food began, and the realisation that I didn’t want to be a prisoner to food any longer. Put simply, \"I made a decision to change.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph (a major UK newspaper), the lovely Anna Richardson talks about how she lost over 35 lbs and kept it off for over four years after just one session with Marisa Peer.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n[image id=\"1560\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\n\nHer interest was sparked during the filming of Supersize vs Superskinny in 2008. Anna had undergone a Regression Session (part of Marisa’s unique method) with well-known celebrity therapist Marisa Peer, and discovered that her own eating habits were formed during early childhood. Her mother was taken into hospital. Her father had tried to comfort Anna—in her mother’s absence—by feeding her treats, fast food, and fizzy drinks.

Since overeating is an emotional issue, it cannot be defeated with logic.\n<h4>So how do we change these behaviors?</h4>\nOne of the most effective methods is weight loss motivation hypnosis. Hypnosis is something you have already experienced many, many times in your everyday life. \n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1578\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\nWhen you are engrossed in a film or activity and lose all track of time, you are experiencing a state similar to hypnosis. When you drive your car on a familiar route on autopilot and don’t even notice you did it, you are in a state of hypnosis.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1585\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\n\nOnly recently, one of America’s leading psychiatrists conducted experiments on volunteers that proved how much the brain could influence our thoughts when under hypnosis. Given that the subconscious mind is responsible for 90% of our actions, if we can change our mind, we can change our behaviour too. So how exactly does it work? Hypnosis alters our state of consciousness in such a way that our conscious (thinking) mind is switched off and our unconscious (emotional) mind is made more alert.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\nBecause the unconscious mind is a deep-seated, more instinctive force, it is this part of the brain that listens to the words the therapist is using and uses them to re-program negative patterns of behaviour.\n\nIn Perfect Weight Forever I will use a safe and effective form of hypnosis to change how you react to food forever.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n[image id=\"2821\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">Research shows that 95% of people find diets ineffective.</h4>\n<b>This is because diets focus on the wrong thing.</b>\n\nAccording to the eating disorder charity BEAT, 88% of people who have eating problems and weight loss problems have these problems because they have an emotional relationship with food. 85% of people comfort eat because they have a negative body image.\n\nEmotional eaters use food to soothe unhappy feelings and to temporarily solve anger, loneliness, and unhappiness because eating temporarily switches off their negative emotions.\n\nThe key emotional states that send you into emotional eating are anger, hurt, loneliness, betrayal, frustrations, jealousy, guilt, resentment, shame, helplessness, powerlessness, stress, tiredness, and many others that may be more subtle. But eating will never cure these feelings; it just makes them worse.\n\nA third of women snack in secret and then feel ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, and out of control, and those negative feelings just make it a vicious circle that keeps the overeating going even though you long to be free of it.\n\nNot only the food you ate as a child, but also your parents’ relationships with food, will affect how you eat. I have so many clients who in hypnosis go back to events that leave them with a belief that says, ‘I can’t eat like other people.’ If your mother rarely gave you candy or punished you by removing candy, if your parents were poor and you only had very basic food, the belief you picked up at a very early age and had reinforced over and over again is: ‘I can’t eat what other people eat,’ ‘I can’t have nice food or treats.\'\n\nThis means that when you’re denied the food that you want and have no power or say in it, of course you long to have the food that other kids have in their lunchbox, in their cupboards, or at their parties.\n\nYears later, when of course you have access to all that food, you still believe that you shouldn’t have it because of your on-going weight battle.\n\nYou still have that old belief ‘It’s not available to me,’ and ‘I can’t have what other people have,’ and ‘Other people get those foods but I don’t.’ Even though you are trying to consciously deny yourself those foods and want to be free of them, what’s happening is that you feel exactly like that kid who didn’t get them and wanted them so much, and now you just want them even more and feel powerless to resist them.\n\nIt is this thinking that sabotages your diet efforts.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\n\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">Why diets, pills and similar treatments like gastric band surgery don’t work</p>\nDiets are too restrictive, which makes them hard to stick to. When you know that 95% of people who go on a diet put all the weight back on within a year (and often some additional weight too), it shows that diets don’t work. The longest time we can stay on a diet is just 6 weeks, and many people only manage a few days.\n\nDiet and exercise don’t tackle the issues that drive people to overeat. There is always an emotional reason, and usually it’s for comfort when people are stressed, unhappy, vulnerable, or bored.\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2830\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\nOver 70% of overeaters are emotional eaters and addictive eaters. Another 20% are habitual and ignorant eaters, and only 10% are angry eaters. You need to know what sort of eater you are before you can address the problem, which is something that no amount of diets, pills, or gastric band treatments can do.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2829\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\n\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">What’s wrong with processed foods like margarine, crisps, chocolates, and candy?</p>\nChips, cakes, chocolates, cookies, pastries, candy, and fast food are NOT foods. Junk food and fast food are not foods at all—they are a cocktail of chemicals, colorings, sugar, trans fat, and preservatives, and the body becomes addicted to these chemicals. They make the body release dopamine the same way drugs do, and as with all addictions we need more and more of the drug just to get the same effect. A diet of burgers, chips, pizza, and cake will program your brain into craving even more foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat, according to new research. Over the years, these junk foods can become a substitute for happiness and will lead binges to become addicted.\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\nMy method teaches you to make the right food choices. It will show you that candy and chocolate are not food and they will never make you feel better. Your body would never ask you for chips or junk food because it hates trying to break down all the fat and chemicals.\n\nThe only part of you that thinks you want this is your mind, and soon you will be controlling, directing, and influencing your mind to be indifferent to rubbish food forever. This does not mean you will never eat cake or candy, it just means you want it less, eat it less, and are satisfied with less all the time.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div align=\"center\">\n<h4>Introducing...

Anna said:\r\n\r\n“For years I’ve struggled with my weight, and I’ve literally tried every diet. I was the reporter for Channel 4’s diet series Supersize vs Superskinny, and my challenge was to immerse myself in the world of extreme diets and to communicate back the truth.”\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Does any of this sound familiar?</h4>\r\n“At the time of being asked, I was a little insulted. In my head I was a svelte 126 lb, size 8 stunner—whereas in reality I was a hefty 161 lb, size 14 porker. Overweight and in complete denial. A fact that only became apparent to me when I agreed to weigh myself on camera for the first time in seven years. I was devastated.\r\n\r\nSo I threw myself with gusto into the diets I was trialling, which included: The Apple Diet (apples... that’s it. Favoured by supermodels), diet pills (ditto), the Baby Food Diet (beloved by Hollywood A listers), the Maple Syrup Diet (beloved by Beyonce), the Baked Bean Diet (beloved by no one), and as a last resort, Liposuction (which went wrong).\r\n\r\nI was by turns constipated, flatulent, hungry, and in pain. And after all this, did I lose any weight? Just a few pounds.”\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"1543\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"1561\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600;\">But then it all changed</h4>\r\n\r\n“The change came when I went to see Marisa Peer for a session. It was while I was under hypnosis that I quite had a ‘lightbulb moment’—an acknowledgment of where my issues with food began, and the realisation that I didn’t want to be a prisoner to food any longer. Put simply, I made a decision to change.\"\r\n\r\nIn an interview with The Telegraph (a major UK newspaper), the lovely Anna Richardson talks about how she lost over 35 lbs and kept it off for over four years after just one session with Marisa Peer.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n[image id=\"1560\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\nHer interest was sparked during the filming of Supersize vs Superskinny in 2008. Anna had undergone a Regression Session (part of Marisa’s unique method) with well-known celebrity therapist Marisa Peer, and discovered that her own eating habits were formed during early childhood. Her mother was taken into hospital. Her father had tried to comfort Anna in her mother’s absence by feeding her treats, fast food, and fizzy drinks. And so a relationship between food and comfort was firmly established.\r\n\r\nYet after one session, where Marisa cured the problem rooted from her past, Anna lost over 35 lbs to settle at under 132 lbs—the exact weight she had told Marisa she considered her perfect weight. \"I found myself making better food choices, without realising it – it was weird,\" she admits.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Introducing Marisa Peer</h4>\r\n\r\nMarisa Peer studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world.

Since overeating is an emotional issue, it cannot be defeated with logic.\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600;\">So how do we change these behaviors?</h4>\r\nOne of the most effective methods is weight loss motivation hypnosis. Hypnosis is something you have already experienced many, many times in your everyday life. When you are engrossed in a film or activity and lose all track of time, you are experiencing a state similar to hypnosis. When you drive your car on a familiar route on autopilot and don’t even notice you did it, you are in a state of hypnosis. \r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"1578\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"1585\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\nOnly recently, one of America’s leading psychiatrists conducted experiments on volunteers that proved how much the brain could influence our thoughts when under hypnosis. Given that the subconscious mind is responsible for 90% of our actions, if we can change our mind, we can change our behaviour too. So how exactly does it work? Hypnosis alters our state of consciousness in such a way that our conscious (thinking) mind is switched off and our unconscious (emotional) mind is made more alert.\r\n\r\nBecause the unconscious mind is a deep-seated, more instinctive force, it is this part of the brain that listens to the words the therapist is using and uses them to re-program negative patterns of behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn Perfect Weight Forever, I will use a safe and effective form of hypnosis to change how you react with food forever.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\" background=\"#0A2E67\" color=\"#FFFFFF\"]\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1 column\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6 column\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FFFF00\">Meet Hannah\r\nIncredible self esteem\r\nTotal weight loss: 98 lbs</h4>\r\n<p>“After nearly 2 decades of struggling with weight, Hannah finally found the answer with Marisa’s method. “I can’t tell you how my self-esteem has changed and the best thing of all is, I know for a fact that the changes I have made to my diet and lifestyle are permanent, this is no fad, no diet, but a lifestyle change and the new me is here to stay!”\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 column\">[image id=\"3185\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">Research shows that 95% of people find diets ineffective</h4>\r\n<b>This is because diets focus on the wrong thing.</b>\r\n\r\nAccording to the eating disorder charity BEAT, 88% of people who have eating problems and weight loss problems have these problems because they have an emotional relationship with food. 85% of people comfort eat because they have a negative body image.\r\n\r\nEmotional eaters use food to soothe unhappy feelings and to temporarily solve anger, loneliness, and unhappiness because eating temporarily switches off their negative emotions.\r\n\r\nThe key emotional states that send you into emotional eating are anger, hurt, loneliness, betrayal, frustrations, jealousy, guilt, resentment, shame, helplessness, powerlessness, stress, tiredness, and many others that may be more subtle. But eating will never cure these feelings; It just makes them worse.\r\n\r\nA third of women snack in secret and then feel ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, and out of control. Those negative feelings just make it a vicious circle that keep the overeating going, even though you long to be free of it.\r\n\r\nNot only the food you ate as a child, but also your parents’ relationships with food, will affect how you eat. I have so many clients who, in hypnosis, go back to events that leave them with a belief that says, ‘I can’t eat like other people.’ If your mother rarely gave you candy or punished you by removing candy, if your parents were poor and you only had very basic food, the belief you picked up at a very early age and had reinforced over and over again is that ‘I can’t eat what other people eat,’ or ‘I can’t have nice food or treats.\'\r\n\r\nThis means that when you’re denied the food that you want and have no power or say in it, you of course long to have the food that other kids have in their lunchbox, in their cupboards, or at their parties.\r\n\r\nYears later, when you have access to all that food, you still believe that you shouldn’t have it because of your on-going weight battle.\r\n\r\nYou still have that old belief that ‘it’s not available to me,’ ‘I can’t have what other people have,’ and ‘other people get those foods but I don’t.’ Even though you are trying to consciously deny yourself those foods and want to be free of them, what’s happening is that you feel exactly like that kid who didn’t get them but wanted them so much, and now you just want them even more and feel powerless to resist them.\r\n\r\nIt is this thinking that sabotages your diet efforts.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">Why diets, pills, and similar treatments like gastric band surgery don’t work</h4>\r\nDiets are too restrictive, which makes them hard to stick to. When you know that 95% of people who go on a diet put all the weight back on within a year, and often some additional weight too, it shows that diets don’t work. The longest time we can stay on a diet is just 6 weeks, and many people only manage a few days.\r\n\r\nDiet and exercise don’t tackle the issues that drive people to overeat. There is always an emotional reason, and usually it’s for comfort when people are stressed, unhappy, vulnerable or bored.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"2830\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"2829\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">What’s wrong with processed foods like margarine, crisps, chocolates, and candy?</h4>\r\nChips, cakes, chocolates, cookies, pastries, candy, and fast food are NOT foods; they are a cocktail of chemicals, colorings, sugar, trans fat, and preservatives, and the body becomes addicted to these chemicals as they make the body release dopamine the same way drugs do. As with all addictions, we need more and more of the drug just to get the same effect. A diet of burgers, chips, pizza, and cake will program your brain into craving even more foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat, according to new research. Over the years these junk foods can become a substitute for happiness and will lead binges to become addicted.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nMy method teaches you to make the right food choices. It will show you that candy and chocolate are not food and they will never make you feel better. Your body would never ask you for chips or junk food because it hates trying to break down all the fat and chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe only part of you that thinks you want this is your mind, and soon you will be controlling, directing, and influencing your mind to be indifferent to rubbish food forever. This does not mean you will never eat cake or candy, it just means you want it less, eat it less, and are satisfied with less all the time.\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\" background=\"#0A2E67\" color=\"#FFFFFF\"]\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1 column\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-6 column\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FFFF00\">Meet Rebecca\r\nNo longer craves sweets \r\nTotal weight loss: 33 lbs</h4>\r\n<p>\"I was eating 7 chocolate bars a day and I found that I got moody if I didn\'t have my fix.

We started discussing the stressors in my life and all of the sudden she said, “your body is telling me to ask you what happened at age 43.” The month after I turned 43, my dad died. I told Lynn that my dad wasn’t a very nice man and never spent time with us. Somehow Lynn connected the neglect from my father and his passing to stress that I had been keeping inside of me.

Daisy was 9 months old when we brought her home, but didn’t play as much as puppies usually do. She liked to cuddle with me on the couch and would go out on the leash for me, but not my husband. He was so bummed that he wouldn’t warm up to her. I called the adoption program and asked if they knew why. It turns out, her previous owner (a male) abandoned her when he moved away. Lynn’s team suggested that we play the Trauma recording on a loop for Daisy.
