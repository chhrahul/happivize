Anna said:\r\n\r\n“For years I’ve struggled with my weight, and I’ve literally tried every diet. I was the reporter for Channel 4’s diet series Supersize vs Superskinny, and my challenge was to immerse myself in the world of extreme diets and to communicate back the truth.”\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Does any of this sound familiar?</p>\r\n“At the time of being asked, I was a little insulted. In my head I was a svelte 126 lb, size 8 stunner—whereas in reality I was a hefty 161 lb size 14 porker. Overweight and in complete denial. A fact that only became apparent to me when I agreed to weigh myself on camera, for the first time in seven years. I was devastated.\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1543\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nSo I threw myself with gusto into the diets I was trialling, which included: The Apple Diet (apples… that’s it. Favoured by supermodels), diet pills (ditto), the Baby Food Diet (beloved by Hollywood A listers), the Maple Syrup Diet (beloved by Beyonce), the Baked Bean Diet (beloved by no-one), and as a last resort, Liposuction (which went wrong).\r\n\r\nI was by turns constipated, flatulent, hungry, and in pain. And after all this, did I lose any weight? Just a few pounds.”\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1561\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">But then it all changed.</p>\r\n\r\n“The change came when I went to see Marisa Peer for a session. It was while I was under hypnosis that I quite had a ‘lightbulb moment’—an acknowledgment of where my issues with food began, and the realisation that I didn’t want to be a prisoner to food any longer. Put simply, \"I made a decision to change.\"\r\n\r\nIn an interview with The Telegraph (a major UK newspaper), the lovely Anna Richardson talks about how she lost over 35 lbs and kept it off for over four years after just one session with Marisa Peer.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[image id=\"1560\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\n\r\nHer interest was sparked during the filming of Supersize vs Superskinny in 2008. Anna had undergone a Regression Session (part of Marisa’s unique method) with well-known celebrity therapist Marisa Peer, and discovered that her own eating habits were formed during early childhood. Her mother was taken into hospital. Her father had tried to comfort Anna—in her mother’s absence—by feeding her treats, fast food, and fizzy drinks. And so a relationship between food and comfort was firmly established.\r\n\r\nYet, after one session where Marisa cured the problem rooted from her past, Anna lost over 35 lbs, to settle at under 132 lbs—the exact weight she had told Marisa she considered her perfect weight. \"I found myself making better food choices, without realising it—it was weird,\" she admits.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600;\">Introducing Marisa Peer</p>\r\n\r\nMarisa Peer studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world.

Since overeating is an emotional issue, it cannot be defeated with logic.\r\n<h4>So how do we change these behaviors?</h4>\r\nOne of the most effective methods is weight loss motivation hypnosis. Hypnosis is something you have already experienced many, many times in your everyday life. \r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1578\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nWhen you are engrossed in a film or activity and lose all track of time, you are experiencing a state similar to hypnosis. When you drive your car on a familiar route on autopilot and don’t even notice you did it, you are in a state of hypnosis.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"1585\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\nOnly recently, one of America’s leading psychiatrists conducted experiments on volunteers that proved how much the brain could influence our thoughts when under hypnosis. Given that the subconscious mind is responsible for 90% of our actions, if we can change our mind, we can change our behaviour too. So how exactly does it work? Hypnosis alters our state of consciousness in such a way that our conscious (thinking) mind is switched off and our unconscious (emotional) mind is made more alert.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nBecause the unconscious mind is a deep-seated, more instinctive force, it is this part of the brain that listens to the words the therapist is using and uses them to re-program negative patterns of behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn Perfect Weight Forever I will use a safe and effective form of hypnosis to change how you react to food forever.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[image id=\"2821\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" /]\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\n<h4 style=\"color:#FF6600\">Research shows that 95% of people find diets ineffective.</h4>\r\n<b>This is because diets focus on the wrong thing.</b>\r\n\r\nAccording to the eating disorder charity BEAT, 88% of people who have eating problems and weight loss problems have these problems because they have an emotional relationship with food. 85% of people comfort eat because they have a negative body image.\r\n\r\nEmotional eaters use food to soothe unhappy feelings and to temporarily solve anger, loneliness, and unhappiness because eating temporarily switches off their negative emotions.\r\n\r\nThe key emotional states that send you into emotional eating are anger, hurt, loneliness, betrayal, frustrations, jealousy, guilt, resentment, shame, helplessness, powerlessness, stress, tiredness, and many others that may be more subtle. But eating will never cure these feelings; it just makes them worse.\r\n\r\nA third of women snack in secret and then feel ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, and out of control, and those negative feelings just make it a vicious circle that keeps the overeating going even though you long to be free of it.\r\n\r\nNot only the food you ate as a child, but also your parents’ relationships with food, will affect how you eat. I have so many clients who in hypnosis go back to events that leave them with a belief that says, ‘I can’t eat like other people.’ If your mother rarely gave you candy or punished you by removing candy, if your parents were poor and you only had very basic food, the belief you picked up at a very early age and had reinforced over and over again is: ‘I can’t eat what other people eat,’ ‘I can’t have nice food or treats.\'\r\n\r\nThis means that when you’re denied the food that you want and have no power or say in it, of course you long to have the food that other kids have in their lunchbox, in their cupboards, or at their parties.\r\n\r\nYears later, when of course you have access to all that food, you still believe that you shouldn’t have it because of your on-going weight battle.\r\n\r\nYou still have that old belief ‘It’s not available to me,’ and ‘I can’t have what other people have,’ and ‘Other people get those foods but I don’t.’ Even though you are trying to consciously deny yourself those foods and want to be free of them, what’s happening is that you feel exactly like that kid who didn’t get them and wanted them so much, and now you just want them even more and feel powerless to resist them.\r\n\r\nIt is this thinking that sabotages your diet efforts.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">Why diets, pills and similar treatments like gastric band surgery don’t work</p>\r\nDiets are too restrictive, which makes them hard to stick to. When you know that 95% of people who go on a diet put all the weight back on within a year (and often some additional weight too), it shows that diets don’t work. The longest time we can stay on a diet is just 6 weeks, and many people only manage a few days.\r\n\r\nDiet and exercise don’t tackle the issues that drive people to overeat. There is always an emotional reason, and usually it’s for comfort when people are stressed, unhappy, vulnerable, or bored.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2830\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nOver 70% of overeaters are emotional eaters and addictive eaters. Another 20% are habitual and ignorant eaters, and only 10% are angry eaters. You need to know what sort of eater you are before you can address the problem, which is something that no amount of diets, pills, or gastric band treatments can do.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 column\"></br>[image id=\"2829\" align=\"none\" size=\"medium\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 column\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#FF6600\">What’s wrong with processed foods like margarine, crisps, chocolates, and candy?</p>\r\nChips, cakes, chocolates, cookies, pastries, candy, and fast food are NOT foods. Junk food and fast food are not foods at all—they are a cocktail of chemicals, colorings, sugar, trans fat, and preservatives, and the body becomes addicted to these chemicals. They make the body release dopamine the same way drugs do, and as with all addictions we need more and more of the drug just to get the same effect. A diet of burgers, chips, pizza, and cake will program your brain into craving even more foods that are high in sugar, salt, and fat, according to new research. Over the years, these junk foods can become a substitute for happiness and will lead binges to become addicted.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-2 column\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8 column\">\r\nMy method teaches you to make the right food choices. It will show you that candy and chocolate are not food and they will never make you feel better. Your body would never ask you for chips or junk food because it hates trying to break down all the fat and chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe only part of you that thinks you want this is your mind, and soon you will be controlling, directing, and influencing your mind to be indifferent to rubbish food forever. This does not mean you will never eat cake or candy, it just means you want it less, eat it less, and are satisfied with less all the time.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<h4>Introducing...

It knows why you are stressed, or why you may not be feeling so loving, or why you don’t like your present situation any longer.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Spirit and the channeled content on each MP3, these blockages and stresses will automatically begin to clear. A more natural and authentic version of yourself will begin to emerge after you have listened to any of the MP3s. After each listening, you can continue with your life as normal.

I had more fluidity, and more range of motion in them.\r\n\r\nYou may already have gotten tons of feedback of this kind, but I just wanted to be sure you know that your own range may be greater than you imagine!”\r\n [/offer_testimonial]\r\n\r\n[offer_testimonial cite=\"~ Marcia\"]\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\nCLEARING OF NECK PAIN\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n“Mia, your group calls are amazing! I\'ve been on almost all of them and they seem to be getting more powerful each time. I feel I am getting the same benefit from the group healings as I do from private sessions with you. During last night\'s call I was quite uncomfortable because my neck was acting up again. It was jammed, tight, and painful. By the end of the call I was very relaxed but my neck wasn\'t any better. Something big shifted while I slept because when I woke up this morning my neck was fine!!

I am very appreciative to be able to move without excruciating pain. My pain level went from a 10 plus to a 3 in a very short time.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nAlso within a week of listening to Mia\'s weight loss MP3s I lost five pounds and I was thrilled as I have been a very resistant case. I felt my body was finally responding. I even planned on eating nothing but smoothies but ate regularly after the first two and lost weight anyway. I appreciate Mia’s generosity, insight and steady belief it could happen. She took me back to my time at college and a volcanic eruption that disrupted my sense of safety.

However, initially I did not give it the attention it deserved. Thus, I gradually became more and more stressed, and only started to take more notice when I developed somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me, my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200).\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-3\">[image id=\"27851\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\nAs a result of my high blood pressure and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could lead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it my all, and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fix the retina issue within weeks, which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day, my blood pressure has been within the normal range without having ever needed any medication.\r\n\r\nAn elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago. By the time I found out, she had already received many hours of physiotherapy, as well as 15 injections. As nothing was helping, she could barely speak from the pain when I phoned her from Australia. With her permission, I started a very intensive daily distant healing process (she lives in the Netherlands), and continued for about 5 days. After the 5 days, she was pain free, and that severe pain never returned. It turned out it was caused by a swelling or bulge around the spinal area called L4. Based on scans prior to my having given her these healings, her specialist had decided she needed an operation. Spirit told me at the end of the 5-day healing that she no longer needed this operation. This was confirmed 3 months later, during a visit to the specialist who was going to perform her operation. This visit had already been booked before I began the healings. She was told by this specialist she no longer needed the operation. That same problem has never returned.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, one of my relatives, who was in her 80s, was diagnosed with end-stage renal failure with less than 10% of her kidneys still working. It was no longer possible for her to get a transplant or receive dialysis because of other major health implications. When I began giving her distant healings, she was already completely bedridden. Within less than two weeks, she was fully mobile again. I was privileged to give her quality of life during that period. Much to the shock and amazement of those around her, she was able to walk and travel and visit family until a few days before her transition 12 weeks later.\"\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rd0FGvNANpU?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6og7XzzZOk?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGd5J6EkRBw?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]', 'Mia den Haan - Divine Soul Essence Healing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1740-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-05-23 21:49:22', '2017-05-24 01:49:22', '', '1740', 'https://happivize.com/1740-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'), ('29962', '1', '2017-05-23 22:07:26', '2017-05-24 02:07:26', '', 'Cart &ndash;

Belly bloat too.\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\nIf anyone’s ever asked you if you were pregnant when you weren’t, you know it’s embarrassing. And frustrating too, because you’re probably eating healthy and exercising regularly — but nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\nWhy is it you just can’t seem to melt that fat and lose the swollen belly? Maybe it’s because you haven’t been focusing on the right things. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nMy name is Dr. Susanne Bennett and I’ve been working with women who want to trim their tummies for years. In my practice, I’ve discovered something troubling: A flabby tummy is often a sign of a deep imbalance in your gut.\r\n\r\nYour gut has an important job to do. It’s supposed to digest food, absorb nutrients and sweep out the waste. But sometimes things get thrown off in there and the result isn’t pretty. Gas, bloating and belly fat are the results and often accompanied by constipation and diarrhea! It’s uncomfortable and (let’s be real) gross.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\nBut here’s the good news.\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\nWhen you get your gut back to normal, all of that disappears naturally. You lose the embarrassing symptoms and best of all, you lose inches off your waist quickly. It happens week by week until a month or two in, you realize you’ve dropped a few sizes and you’re no longer reflexively sucking in your gut when you go out. You feel great about your body for the first time in years.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[/offer_section]', 'Susanne Bennett - Flat Sexy Belly', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29977-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-05-24 21:54:54', '2017-05-25 01:54:54', '', '29977', 'https://happivize.com/29977-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'), ('30168', '1', '2017-05-24 22:28:24', '2017-05-25 02:28:24', '', 'Cart &ndash;

We are all packets of energy, interacting with each other.\r\n\r\nA relationship is the interaction of two energy patterns, yours and theirs.\r\n\r\nMost relationships are an unconscious reaction between the energies. The energies that both people give create a specific result. Usually that energy is given on autopilot. When we try changing the words and the actions, we just don’t see the change we’d like.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the secret: When you start to change your own personal energy that you are contributing to the relationship, then you start to see a shift.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"full\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-1\" style=\"margin-left:50px\">[image id=\"29987\" align=\"right\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\" style=\"margin-right:50px\">\r\n<p>Our own personal energy has a TREMENDOUS effect on how we experience things.

Are they gonna love me?” they should say, “How can I love?”\n\nIf Nina keeps placing her happiness on random men, she will continue to attract the exact same guys over and over.

Her agenda is NOT to make sure at least 7 guys hit on her tonight.\n\nAnd when guys see this girl enjoying herself (i.e. loving herself), they find this instantly attractive.\n\nApproaching her would be fun!!

Every day she wakes up earlier than everyone else and cooks a big breakfast. She then cleans up, herself, after all that work because she wants to.\r\n\r\nShe knows the whole family has to go to work and school, so she WANTS to help them. She spoils the heck out of the grandkids, and happily babysits them at a moment\'s notice if her daughter wants to go out. The elderly mother loves the opportunity to live out her remaining years being so close to family.\r\n\r\nEven her son-in-law, who was initially hesitant about having her stay with the family, has come around to love her and appreciate how much better the family lives (and how much more freedom he has with his wife) thanks to the mother living with him.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Now imagine instead</p>\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n\r\nThis elderly mother wakes up every morning and thinks about how bad her life is. She scowls at the thought that she’s old and alone, and that she has to live with her daughter because she isn’t independent enough.\r\n\r\nBecause she sits around all day doing nothing, it makes her even crankier. She wants to yell at the children, her daughter, and her idiot son-in-law for EVERYTHING, but instead, she fake-smiles all the time to make it seem like she’s a nice person, even though everyone can still smell the tension in the air.\r\n\r\nIt fools no one.\r\n\r\nShe then thinks, “It’d be better if I were dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd deep down inside, maybe her daughter thinks so too...\r\n\r\nCan you clearly see what the elderly mother is doing wrong?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, she starts out her thinking process by thinking about everything that’s wrong in her life. Before her feet hit the ground in the morning, she’s already negative about everything. She then goes on to blame her daughter, her son-in-law, her deceased husband, her doctor, and her bratty grandkids for her miserable situation. She never once thinks that there’s something wrong with what SHE is doing.\r\n\r\nIt’s always someone else at fault.\r\n\r\nHer daughter isn’t considerate of what she needs.\r\n\r\nHer son-in-law isn’t thoughtful about her needs.\r\n\r\nHer bratty grandkids only ask her to play games they like, and never think about what she likes.\r\n\r\nThen she says, “I wish I had a different family!

(Hint: it’s you.)\r\n\r\n-- Nina blames men for not approaching her when she looks at them for six seconds.\r\n\r\n-- The elderly woman blames every member of the family for not doing exactly as she wants (but never opens her mouth to tell them).\r\n\r\n-- Nina and the elderly woman could love themselves more.\r\n\r\nInstead of asking, \"Are they gonna love me? Are they gonna love me?” they should say, “How can I love?”\r\n\r\nIf Nina keeps placing her happiness on random men, she will continue to attract the exact same guys over and over. She will continue doing superficial things like “smiling for six seconds” and “going to the right places to meet a man\"—shallow tactics and strategies—rather than doing the inner work necessary to truly transform her relationship to love.\r\n\r\n<b>What does she need to do?</b>\r\n\r\nShe could benefit from being loved up more by learning to love herself.

And she’s wearing flats, but this bar is a heels kind of place.\"\r\n\r\n...But guys keep going up to this frumpy girl, and skipping over Nina, even though she did her “smile at a guy for six seconds” routine.\r\n\r\nShe blows off the girl, thinking, “Oh, she’s easy, and will probably sleep with a guy right away, so that’s why they approach her. Yup, THAT’S WHY.”\r\n\r\nNina is justifying it in her head. You can smell the denial more than her designer perfume.\r\n\r\nBut the real reason why guys are approaching the “alright-looking” girl is because she is with her friends, laughing it up, having a great time, and is at that bar to simply have a fun time with her friends.\r\n\r\nHer agenda is NOT to meet men.
