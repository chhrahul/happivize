Because she wants to.\r\nShe knows the whole family has to go to work and school, so she WANTS to help them.She spoils the heck out of the grandkids, and happily babysits them at a moments notice if her daughter wants to go out.The elderly mother loves the opportunity to live out her remaining years being so close to family.\r\nEven her son-in-law who was initially hesitant about having her stay with the family, has come around to love her, and appreciate how much better the family lives (and gives him more freedom with his wife) thanks to the mother living with him.</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Now Imagine Instead</p>\r\n[/offer_heading]\r\n<div class=\"row\">This elderly mother wakes up every morning, and thinks about how bad her life is. She scowls at the thought she’s old and alone, and that she has to live with her daughter because she isn’t independent enough.Because she sits around all day doing nothing, it makes her even crankier. She wants to yell at the children, her daughter, and her idiot son-in-law for EVERYTHING but instead, she fake-smiles all the time to make it seem like she’s a nice person, but everyone can still smell the tension in the air.It fools no one.She then thinks, “It’d be better if I were dead.”And deep down inside, maybe her daughter thinks so too….\r\nCould you clearly see what the elderly mother is doing wrong?First of all, she starts out her thinking process by thinking about everything that’s wrong in her life.Before her feet hit the ground in the morning, she’s already negative about anything.She then blames her daughter, her son-in-law, her deceased husband, her doctor, her bratty grandkids for her miserable situation. She never once thinks that there’s something wrong SHE is doing.It’s always someone else at fault.Her daughter isn’t considerate of what she needs.\r\nHer son-in-law isn’t thoughtful about her needs.\r\nHer bratty grandkids only ask her to play games they like, and never think about what she likes.Then she says, “I wish I had a different family!

She will continue doing superficial things like “smiling for six seconds” and “going to the right places to meet a man”.Shallow tactics and strategy rather doing the inner work necessary to truly transform her relationship to love.<b>What does she need to do?</b>She could benefit from being loved up more by learning to love herself.Instead, Nina gets PISSED OFF when she sees this girl across the bar….she looks like she didn’t even do her hair before meeting her friends at the bar. Idiot. And she’s wearing flats, but this bar is a heels kind of place.\r\n\r\n…….but guys keep going up to this frumpy girl, and skip over Nina, even though she did her “smile at a guy for six seconds” routine.\r\n\r\nShe blows off this girl thinking, “Oh she’s easy and will probably sleep with a guy right away, so that’s why they approach her. Yup, THAT’S WHY.”\r\n\r\nNina is justifying it in her head. You can smell the denial more than her designer perfume.\r\n\r\nBut the reason guys are approaching the “alright looking” girl is because she is with her friends, laughing it up, having a great time, and is at that bar to simply have a fun time with her friends.\r\n\r\nHer agenda is NOT to meet men. Her agenda is NOT to make sure at least 7 guys hit on her tonight.\r\n\r\nAnd when guys see this girl enjoying herself (i.e. loving herself), they find this instantly attractive.\r\n\r\nApproaching her would be fun!!
