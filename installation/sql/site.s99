I told Lynn that my dad wasn’t a very nice man and never spent time with us. Somehow Lynn connected the neglect from my father and his passing to stress that I had been keeping inside of me.

We started discussing the stressors in my life and all of the sudden she said, “your body is telling me to ask you what happened at age 43.” The month after I turned 43, my dad died. I told Lynn that my dad wasn’t a very nice man and never spent time with us. Somehow Lynn connected the neglect from my father and his passing to stress that I had been keeping inside of me.

This authentic self knows why you were born. It knows the overall direction of your life at any given moment. It completely understands you and knows what is needed to heal the obstacles you are dealing with. It knows why you are stressed or may not be feeling so loving or why you don’t like your present situation any longer.\r\n\r\nWith the help of spirit and the channeled content on each MP3, these blockages and stresses will automatically begin to clear. A more natural and authentic version of yourself will begin to emerge after you have listened to any of the MP3s. After each listening you can continue with your life as normal. Spirit knows the right timing for each of the embedded clearings. The wisdom of your soul and spirit will do all the clearings for you, while you can continue with your normal day-to-day living.\r\n\r\nThis Divine healing process is unique and was given to Mia in 2002, after which her healings became more profound and she was able to perform more and more miracle healings.

Thus I became gradually more and more stressed and only started to take more notice when I had a somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200). \r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-3\">[image id=\"27851\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\nResulting from that and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could lead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it all and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fixed the retina issue within weeks which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day my blood pressure has been within the normal range without ever needing any medication.\r\n\r\nAn elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago. By the time I found out she had already received many hours of physiotherapy as well as 15 injections. As nothing was helping she could barely speak from the pain when I phoned her from Australia. With her permission I started a very intensive daily distant healing process (she lives in the Netherlands) for about 5 days. After the 5 days she was pain free and that severe pain never returned. It turned out it was caused by a swelling or bulge around the spinal area called L4. Based on scans prior to giving her these healings, her specialist had decided she needed an operation. Spirit told me at the end of the 5 days healing that she no longer needed this operation. This was confirmed 3 months later, during a visit to the specialist who was going to perform her operation. This visit was already booked before I began the healings. She was told by this specialist she no longer needed the operation. That same problem has never returned.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago one of my relatives who was in her 80s, was diagnosed with end stage renal failure with less than 10% of her kidneys still working. It was no longer possible for her to get a transplant or receive dialysis because of other major health implications. When I began giving her distant healings she was already completely bedridden. Within less than two weeks she was fully mobile again. I was privileged to give her quality of life during that period. Much to the shock and amazement of those around her she was able to walk and travel and visit family until a few days before her transition 12 weeks later.\"\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rd0FGvNANpU?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6og7XzzZOk?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGd5J6EkRBw?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]'), ('11481', '1010', 'post_new_post_content', '[image id=\"3806\" align=\"center\" size=\"full\" /]\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n[offer_tagline]Mia Den Haan\'s Special Offer[/offer_tagline]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<ul class=\"dnc-wc-offers-list-stars\">\r\n<li>Improve the quality of love that is already present within your self</li>\r\n<li>Clear environmental triggers or memory patterns that are blocking your love from flowing freely</li>\r\n<li>Release blocks to allow for more loving relationships with others in your life</li>\r\n<li>Increase mental and emotional wellbeing</li>\r\n<li>Reduce stress levels, panic attacks, anxiety, trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]Experience more love in all areas of your life[/offer_heading]\r\n[offer_heading type=\"heading\"]BUILD YOUR LOVE FLOW FROM WITHIN WITH ASSISTANCE\r\nFROM THE YOUR DIVINE SOUL ESSENCE™\r\nHEALING METHOD[/offer_heading]\r\n[offer_heading type=\"subheading\"]Become whole with assistance from the Divine within[/offer_heading]\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\nAttract more love in your life through the healing power of Spirit.

This authentic self knows why you were born. It knows the overall direction of your life at any given moment. It completely understands you and knows what is needed to heal the obstacles you are dealing with. It knows why you are stressed, or why you may not be feeling so loving, or why you don’t like your present situation any longer.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Spirit and the channeled content on each MP3, these blockages and stresses will automatically begin to clear. A more natural and authentic version of yourself will begin to emerge after you have listened to any of the MP3s. After each listening, you can continue with your life as normal. Spirit knows the right timing for each of the embedded clearings. The wisdom of your Soul and Spirit will do all the clearings for you, while you can continue with your normal day-to-day living.\r\n\r\nThis Divine healing process is unique and was given to Mia in 2002, after which her healings became more profound, and she was able to perform more and more miracle healings.

However, initially I did not give it the attention it deserved. Thus, I gradually became more and more stressed, and only started to take more notice when I developed somewhat blurred vision in one eye. Ironically, I was denying my spiritual guidance and did not want to see the truth! Unbeknown to me, my blood pressure was far too high (around 190-200).\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-3\">[image id=\"27851\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\nAs a result of my high blood pressure and other work related stresses, my retina had started detaching, which could lead to blindness if not treated. As I only had weeks before I was scheduled for laser surgery, I decided to give it my all, and was able to reverse the high blood pressure and fix the retina issue within weeks, which the eye specialist later confirmed. Thus I avoided laser surgery. To this day, my blood pressure has been within the normal range without having ever needed any medication.\r\n\r\nAn elderly family member suffered from severe sciatic pains on one side of her body many years ago.

It\'s part and parcel of this human experience!\r\n\r\nBUT through the process of living and interpreting things (especially when you are a child and don\'t understand why people do what they do), you start carrying layer after layer of pain and judgment and criticism that blocks your access to this love.\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"27782\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n[/offer_section]\r\n\r\n[offer_section width=\"narrow\"]\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">[image id=\"27783\" align=\"none\" size=\"thumbnail\" /]</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\nYou infer from your experiences that you are not enough because otherwise:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>that guy would have been happy with you, or</li>\r\n<li>you would have got that job, or</li>\r\n<li>been on the swim team, or</li>\r\n<li>accepted into that college, or</li>\r\n<li>your parent would have loved you more...</li>\r\nand it builds up until it seems like the truth.

...\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do you feel satisfied with all areas of your life?</li>\r\n<li>Is your romantic life, your finances, your close relationships, your career, your FUN as fun and enjoyable as you want it to be?</li>\r\n<li>Do you feel totally resilient when life throws you a curve ball?</li>\r\n<li>Do you enjoy the success you already have while joyfully reaching for more?</li>\r\n<li>Even when circumstances are out of control you feel calm and happy to be alive?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you answer No to any of those, I can tell you that connecting with your self-love makes all of that possible.\r\n\r\nIt\'s true you cannot control life or other people, but you can develop the resources within to feel strong and centered no matter what happens around you.\r\n\r\nI want to help you
