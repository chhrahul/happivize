# JW Player Developer SDKs

## JavaScript Providers

Info about writing javascript media providers can be found in the [providers](providers) directory.

## Flash Providers

JW6 Flash providers are supported in JW Player 7, but is considered partner restricted. We supply limited support for providers developed in Flash. Use the [jw6-flash-provider-sdk](jw6-flash-provider-sdk) readme and source examples on your own.

## Plugins

JW6 plugins are supported in JW Player 7 for legacy purposes. If you need JavaScript or Flash loaded into the player based on player setup config, [jw6-plugin-sdk](jw6-plugin-sdk) may be for you.

## Skins

The JW Player 6 XML format for skins has been deprecated and is no longer used in JW Player 7. The [jw6-skin-sdk](jw6-skin-sdk) is kept here for users with legacy players.

JW Player 7's UI is always rendered in html and can be customized with CSS. More info can be found [here](http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1412123-building-jw-player-skins).
