This plugin was designed with seamless template overriding in mind.  The following pseudo-hierarchy is employed:
single-dnc-wc-offer
	header-dnc-wc-offer
	content-dnc-wc-offer
	footer-dnc-wc-offer

If the relevant file is located in the theme (child or parent), it is used.  Else, the one from the plugin is used.  Additionally, the single_template filter is used to allow the injection of the above single-dnc-wc-offer template.  It has higher priority than single, if the post-type is dnc-wc-offer.

There is no default archive template provided, as it was requested that there be no automatic archive listing.
