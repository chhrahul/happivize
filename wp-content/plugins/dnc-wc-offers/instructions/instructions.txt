Instructions for "Simple Offer Pages" (dnc-wc-offer)
Prepared 2017, Designs and Codes, LLC

In this folder, you will find the instructions for our plugin.  I've broken them out into major sections, to hopefully keep it from getting too long & complicated.  Each comes in a .txt, as well as a .docx version.  Both versions contain the same information.

* shortcodes covers all of the shortcodes added by this plugin, since you may need to refer back to them from time-to-time.
* editors gives an overview of the Offer editor (and its various sub-editors), and is targeted at editors.
* developers covers things that template and plugin developers will want to know, in addition to the things above.

All code is licensed MIT, as per below.  In short, you can do what you want with the code (including resale).
